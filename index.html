- Google Search (which must be called index.html).
- There should be links in the upper-right of the page
  to go to Image Search or Advanced Search.
- The user should be able to type in a query,
  click “Google Search”, and be taken to the Google search
  results for that page.
- Your search bar should be centered with rounded corners.
  The search button should also be centered,
  and should be beneath the search bar.
